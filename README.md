# NdrLookup [![Build Status](https://github.com/publichealthengland/ndr_lookup/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/publichealthengland/ndr_lookup/actions?query=workflow%3Atest)

This is the Public Health England (PHE) National Disease Registers (NDR) Lookup ruby gem,
providing:

1. an ArcGIS LocatorHub API client
2. NHS Digital Organisation Data Service API Client

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ndr_lookup'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ndr_lookup

## Usage

### ArcGIS LocatorHub API Client

`NdrLookup::LocatorHub::Client` is a client to access the LocatorHub API to rectify given addresses.

The client isn't included by default, so add the following to your code:

```ruby
require 'ndr_lookup/locator_hub/client'
```

It requires some manual setup:

Configuration | Description
--- | ---
`domain` | A string of the authenicating domain name.
`username` | A string of the authenticating username.
`password` | A string of the authenticating password.

Within a Rails application, you should do this in an initializer, preferably using encrypted credentials, e.g.:

```ruby
# This file configures NdrLookup.
Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  NdrLookup::LocatorHub::Client.domain = Rails.application.credentials.production[:locator_hub_api][:domain]
  NdrLookup::LocatorHub::Client.username = Rails.application.credentials.production[:locator_hub_api][:username]
  NdrLookup::LocatorHub::Client.password = Rails.application.credentials.production[:locator_hub_api][:password]
end
```

### NHS Digital Organisation Data Service API Client

NdrLookup::NhsdOds::Client is a client to access the NHS Digital ODS API search and sync endpoints.

Sync will return a JSON format payload for all organisations that have been updated since the specified date:

```ruby
require 'ndr_lookup/nhsd_ods/client'

organisation_ids = NdrLookup::NhsdOds::Client.sync(Date.new(2019, 6, 14))
```

*NOTE* that the client isn't included by default, so you have to require it specifically.

Search will allow you to search based on parameters specified by ODS
https://digital.nhs.uk/services/organisation-data-service/guidance-for-developers/search-endpoint#parameters

For example:

```ruby
require 'ndr_lookup/nhsd_ods/client'

results = NdrLookup::NhsdOds::Client.search(Name: 'NHS Digital')
```

NdrLookup::NhsdOds::Organisation will enable you to access the NHS Digital ODS API to find a specific organisation.

Lookup will return an Organisation object with model like behaviours:

```ruby
require 'ndr_lookup/nhsd_ods/organisation'

organisation = NdrLookup::NhsdOds::Organisation.find('X26')
```

NdrLookup::NhsdOds::CodeSystems will enable you to access the NHS Digital ODS API to find the meta data information included in the payload records returned via the endpoints. CodeSystems currently includes roles, relationships and record classes.

```ruby
require 'ndr_lookup/nhsd_ods/code_systems'

role = NdrLookup::NhsdOds::Role.find('RO197')
first_relationship = NdrLookup::NhsdOds::Rel.first
all_record_classes = NdrLookup::NhsdOds::Recordclass.all
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
